            <p>
                All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive
                termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity
                and limitations of liability.

                Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of
                those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
                remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire
                agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might
                have between us regarding the Service.

            <h5 class="mb-5">E. Changes</h5>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a
                revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking
                effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
